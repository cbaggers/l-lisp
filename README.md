# L-Lisp

Load the package e.g. ```(ql:quickload :l-lisp)``` and switch to the lsx namespace/package ```(in-package :lsx)```

```
LSX> (timed-preview (make-instance 'gtree))

LSX> (gl-preview (make-instance 'gtree))

LSX> (gl-preview (make-instance 'gtree) :depth 6)

LSX> (gl-animation (make-instance 'climbing1))

LSX> (gl-animation (make-instance 'gtree) :recenter t)
```

## Examples known to not (currently) work
- fibonacci
- signal-test

## L-Lisp: Lindenmayer systems in Lisp

L-Lisp is a framework for generating and simulating plants and fractals in
Common Lisp.

This is the first public version of L-Lisp.  Currently only CMU Common Lisp
is supported, but porting to other CL implementations should be relatively
easy.  For Unix/X11 systems, OpenGL previews are possible, but the framework
does not depend on them.

L-Lisp is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL), see the file
COPYING for details.


### INSTALLATION

It is recommended to download and the OpenGL bindings for CMUCL first.
Get them from [here](http://www.ii.uib.no/~knute/lisp/lisp.html)

The build system used is MK-DEFSYSTEM, this is included with most new
distributions of CMUCL as far as I know.  In case it is not, you can get
it [directly from CVS](http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/clocc/clocc/src/defsystem-3.x/)

In l-lisp.system, change the *l-lisp-dir* path to point to your installation
directory.  Then, compiling and loading should be as easy as:

```
 (mk:compile-system :l-lisp)
 (mk:load-system :l-lisp)
```

(You might see some notes during complation; ignore them.  Hopefully no
warnings or errors, though.)

To test your installation, go to the LSX (L-SYSTEM-EXAMPLES) package and
try out some of the classes in the examples.lisp file, for instance:

```
 (in-package :lsx)
 (rewrite-and-preview (make-instance 'snowflake) "snowflake.eps"
                      :depth 4)
 (rewrite-and-raytrace (make-instance 'stree) "stree.pov")
 (gl-preview (make-instance 'stree))
```

The two first examples depend on the programs "gv" and "povray", and
the last requires that the OpenGL/Xlib bindings are present and working.


###  DOCUMENTATION

My thesis "L-Systems, Twining Plants, Lisp" includes documentation on
L-Lisp and an introduction to L-systems in general.  An XVI version
without images is included in the doc/ directory, for the full version
go to [here](http://www.ii.uib.no/~knute/lsystems/llisp.html)


### NOTES

This was my first Common Lisp project, and a great learning experience.
There are probably some traces of my novice mistakes in my code, feel free
to point them out to me.  :-)

Send questions, feedback, bug reports, etc, to knute@ii.uib.no.  You can
often find me on #lisp (irc.openprojects.net), my nick is Soulman.

Hack away, and have fun.
